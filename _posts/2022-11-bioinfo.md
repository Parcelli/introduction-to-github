My bioinformatics journey began at icipe where we were introduced to
the program, how it will run and some rules to abide by. We were then asked to put pen on
paper concerning the short-term and the long-term goals together with a road map to
achieving them. Writing down my goals ensured that I never lost sight of the bigger picture
and helped me get my vision clearer.
